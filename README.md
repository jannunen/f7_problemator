## Install Dependencies

First of all we need to install dependencies, run in terminal

```
npm install
```

## RAWG API

This demo app uses [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) for search functionality.

In order to keep using this API, you need to sign up and obtain API key at [RAWG website](https://rawg.io/apidocs). It has free plan.

After registering your app, you need to put "API key" to the `.env` file:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API Key
VITE_APP_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## NPM Scripts

- ðŸ”¥ `start` - run development server
- ðŸ”§ `dev` - run development server
- ðŸ”§ `build` - build web app for production

## Vite

There is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) bundler setup. It compiles and bundles all "front-end" resources. You should work only with files located in `/src` folder. Vite config located in `vite.config.js`.

## PWA

This is a PWA. Don't forget to check what is inside of your `service-worker.js`. It is also recommended that you disable service worker (or enable "Update on reload") in browser dev tools during development.

## Assets

Assets (icons, splash screens) source images located in `assets-src` folder. To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 assets --ui
```

## Connect to Git

It is possible to connect this project folder to the new repository. For example for GitHub:

1. Create new GitHub repository at https://github.com/new

2. Initialize Git. In terminal run:

   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add remote origin. Replace $USERNAME and $REPOSITORY with your GitHub username and newly created repository name:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/$USERNAME/$REPOSITORY.git
   ```

That is all, after that you can track, commit and push/pull to repo, for example:

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin master
```
